# BioStructNet
BioStructNet is a structure-based deep learning model designed to enhance the prediction of enzyme-substrate interactions, particularly focusing on biocatalysis. It includes transfer learning approaches for small, function-based datasets. The parameters are validated through molecular docking and MD simulations.
